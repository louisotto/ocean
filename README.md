# About Ocean
Ocean is a lightweight, open-source web app that's easy to configure and quick to learn. It uses Node and Express on the back-end, along with Bootstrap 4, Flat-UI, Animate.css and Wow.js on the front-end.

Templates are handled by Jade, but it's easy to use EJS, or even plain HTML if you'd like.

# Installation
Download the package, cd into the directory and install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

#Running

If you have Nodemon installed, you can run the app with:

```
npm start
```

If you aren't using Nodemon, open package.json and edit line 6 to read:

```
"start": "node ./bin/www"
```
